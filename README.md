# Multimedia Retrieval assignment

## Description

...

## Geting started

In order to get the project started first run the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
In order to run up the database run `docker-compose up`

For the technical report I've set up a latex file in overleaf, please follow this link `https://www.overleaf.com/1781678451tvmkmtkhcrbg`

## TODO

Download the benchmark dataset from princeton and put it here (the website was down)

Disscuss about step 1 (working but not sure if we should use matplotlib),
I suggest we use pymeshlab for working with meshes and objects because it is from my point of view one of the best (for now) for working in python
